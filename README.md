Internship Contract between STEMJets here in referred to as the ‘employer’ and Tolulope Afolabi here in referred to as the ‘intern’
Brief Company Profile
STEMJets is a revolutionary education project geared at grooming the next generation of technovators. At STEMJets our aim is to raise awareness of subjects in the field of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics in pre-university aged students and their immediate community which includes educators, parents and caregivers. We achieve this through the art of storytelling and hands-on learning to create a safe space for collaboration and cocreation. STEMJets was established with the simple ideology that ‘Education needs to meet with the problems it seeks to address’, in other words educational curricular needs to be dynamic and targeted at the current challenges facing our society. Most of the disinterest in STEM is because no direct connection between the classroom teaching is made to day to day experiences, hence the kids do not see the value that science adds to their lives.
STEMJets offers a possibility of taking science subjects/topics and linking them to real life applications on a case by case basis such that the kids can see not only the confusing subject pathways but also the wider picture as to how the content of these subjects relate to their daily lives. STEMJets aims to support and improve existing school curriculum with practice based and experiential learning techniques. Our mission is to build support systems for the African educational system and to be vehicles for improving education access and the quality.
We aim to explore the applications of different scientific principles and help our target group apply it in a fun way where they get to create videos, engage in games and basically live the reality of science.
At this point in its lifecycle STEMJets is curating a short story series that involves a deliberate process of character formation. This process will be informed by research of the current gap between general school curriculum and the 21st century skill requirement. The short story series will explore themes around the SDGs in Nigeria’s local context as a step toward contributing to sustainable development.
